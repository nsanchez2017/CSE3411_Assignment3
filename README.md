# UniLife Game App

## Synopsis
  A game written in Java that simulates a university student's struggle to simultaneously maintain a good academic record and a healthy lifestyle. Players attempt to move the student left and right to catch the maximal amount of Burgers (nutrition), Sleeping Faces (sleep) and Books (academics). 
  If the student fails to catch enough of any of these categories, as indicated by the lifebars at the top right corner of the game, the game will be over. The final score represents the total number of objects collected by the student. 
  There are also two bonus objects: Beer and Coffee. Collecting coffee will momentarily speed up the student, while collecting beer will freeze the student for a couple of seconds. 

## Motivation
  We took on this project in order to learn about GUI programming in Java using the Java Swing toolkit. We thought it would be interesting to design a game that depicts the struggles of university students like us. We decided to put the project on Github for other people interested in getting started with GUI programming in Java. We would recommend starting with the J Swing tutorials: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/.

## Instruction
  To run the game, download and run the UniLife-Game.jar file. Make sure you have Java installed.
